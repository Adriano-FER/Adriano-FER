Im Adriano,
I have been working in HTML5 , CSS3 , Javascript and React so far,
You can check some of my solo projects and collabs,
So far im trying to learn as much as i can in frontend before approaching to backend and becoming a full stack developer,
im looking foward to show my skills, and learn in the progress, so im open to any collab.
Thanks!
